# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project is made up of five (5) pages. Each page has 5 items(but for the home
page that has 4 items) on the menu on top of each page to help one navigate
through the site

#index.html
It contains a table, and 3 paragraphs. Here, I have demonstrated the use of
at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least
one use of SCSS inheritance, as written in styles.scss.

#aboutMe.html
It contains a short story about me

#football.html
Here, I have written some stories about football. I have demonstrated the use
of bootstrap4, list(ordered and unordered). I also included an image.

#myInterest.html
This shows some areas I am interested in. I also used SCSS to give the text on this
page a yellow color.

#generalKnowledge.html
This page gives some general knowledge on HIV/AIDS.

# Styling
I have use two stylesheet files(styles.css created from styles,scss and style.css
In style.css, i have included media query that changes the background to blue,  
text color to white and displays links on various pages in block when the screen is
smaller than or equal to 592px.
