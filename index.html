         <h2>Data Mining</h2>

         <p class="dm_color">
           Data mining is a term from computer science. Sometimes it is also called knowledge
           discovery in databases (KDD). Data mining is about finding new information in a lot
            of data. The information obtained from data mining is hopefully both new and useful.
            In many cases, data is stored so it can be used later.

          <h2>Wed Development</h2>
          <p id="inherit">Web developers design and create websites. They are responsible for the look of the
            site. They are also responsible for the site's technical aspects, such as its performance
            and capacity, which are measures of a website's speed and how much traffic the site can handle.</p>
