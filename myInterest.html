         The following are my areas of interest:</p>
         <ul>

           <li><h4>Dancing</h4>
            <p>If you dance with someone, romantically, it depicts love and your bond with your partner.
            Symbolism: Dancing represents sexuality, happiness, contentment, victory, confidence and also celebration</p>
           </li>
           <li><h4>Singing</h4>
          <p>Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice, and augments regular speech by
             the use of both tonality and rhythm. One who sings is called a singer or vocalist. ... In many
             respects human song is a form of sustained speech, nearly anyone able to speak can also sing</p>
           </li>
           <li><h4>Reading</h4>
            <p>Reading is defined as a cognitive process that involves decoding symbols to arrive at meaning.
               Reading is an active process of constructing meanings of words. Reading with a purpose helps the
